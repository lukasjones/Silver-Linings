    <h2 class="first">OUR MISSION</h2>
    <p>
        The mission of Silver Linings is to enhance people's lives through music, art, and film, to help 
        cure diseases like cystic fibrosis and cancer (and to make the lives of people afflicted by these 
        diseases a little better), to improve our planet by helping people conserve our limited resources, 
        and to provide education and opportunities to our youth.
    </p>
    <p>Some of the organizations we have funded include Cystic Fibrosis Research, Inc. (CFRI), the Elf 
        Foundation, the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the American Red Cross, Architects of a New Dawn (led by 
        Carlos Santana), Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford, the Tech Museum, South Peninsula 
        Community Teen Youth Group, Caring for Kids (through the NFL Alumni Organization), and Mountain View 
        High School's music program. 
    </p>
