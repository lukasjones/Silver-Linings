        <p class="first">Silver Linings is a 501(c)(3) California non-profit organization whose mission is to enhance people’s lives through music, 
            film, and art. We make the lives of people afflicted by illness a little better. Silver Linings believes that helping others 
            is the magnum opus of life's performances. 
        </p>
        <p>    
            From helping to raise money for cystic fibrosis research to joining forces with Carlos 
            Santana’s Architects of a New Dawn project, to working with Caring for Kids through the NFL Alumni Organization to helping to raise 
            funds for the retrofit of Lucile Packard Children's Hospital's 'Rooms of Magic,' Silver Linings, our contributions are made as 
            charitable gifts to other organizations dedicated helping our planet and its inhabitants.
        </p>
       

            <h2>Events</h2>
        <p>
            Silver Linings, with cooperation from Audio High, recently produced an eight-concert series of the complete Beethoven piano
             sonatas with renowned pianist Robert Silverman. These concerts will soon be available as a CD set produced by Audio High. 
            Proceeds from these concerts, and sales of the CDs, will directly benefit the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.
        </p>
            We invite your help with one of our regularly scheduled benefit concerts or other events.
            <h2>No Overhead</h2>

            Because Audio High donates office space, staff, and other operational support, 100% of the money we raise goes to the charitable 
            causes that we support. 

            <h2>Tax Deductible</h2>

            All donations made to Silver Linings are tax-deductible. Concert tickets and auctioned goods carry a trade value, and deductibility 
            will vary. Direct donations are 100% deductible.
